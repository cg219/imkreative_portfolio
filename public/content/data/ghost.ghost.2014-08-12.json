Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at `<your blog URL>/ghost/`. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGhost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in url, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.\n\n> Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.\n\n    .awesome-thing {\n        display: block;\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n\n### Ready for a Break? \n\nThrow 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.\n\n---\n\n### Advanced Usage\n\nThere's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can  write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.\n\n<input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"I'm an input field!\" />\n\nThat should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)","html":"<p>You're live! Nice.

In this edition I tried to find out some new and interesting combos WITHOUT using an assist. I'll give you the run down on what I thought was interesting about each combo. Also I might end up throwing together a Kreative Lab 4.5 perhaps of all the combos I didn't use in this video.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<h2><a title=\"Amaterasu UMVC3\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5eSoM9jefs&amp;t=0m20s\" target=\"_blank\">Amaterasu Combo : 0:20 - Air S into Medium</a></h2>\r\nI actually came across this by mistake ( like I usually do ), If you are low enough to the ground you can actually catch an Air S with a really quick Medium into Launcher. I'm going to experiment more with this and see if I can pull it off multiple times in a single combo.\r\n<h2><a title=\"Captain America UMVC3\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5eSoM9jefs&amp;t=0m32s\" target=\"_blank\">Captain America : 0:32 - Jump Loop</a></h2>\r\nI've always loved jump loops in UMvC3, they always look kind of cool and awkward, depending on the character. My initial goal with this combo was to try and do as much damage before I launched them in the air. Since Cap can't fly, a jump loop is what came to mind.\r\n<h2><a title=\"Doctor Doom UMVC3\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5eSoM9jefs&amp;t=0m44s\" target=\"_blank\">Doctor Doom : 0:44 - Green Corner Laser</a></h2>\r\nCame up with this trying to figure out if I can use Doom's Laser in a combo without being in a TAC situation. I actually came up with about 4 or 5 variations of this corner combo ( some with more foot dives, others with ALOT more dashes ), but decided to just put this one in the video. I don't know about everyone else, but it always bothered me when someone makes a combo video with about 10 combos and they all start off exactly the same with different finishers. My goal is just to get the idea in your head and let you run with it. I may make another video of all the throwaway combos if people are really interested in it.\r\n<h2><a title=\"Hsien-Ko UMVC3\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5eSoM9jefs&amp;t=0m56s\" target=\"_blank\">Hsien-Ko : 0:56 - Gong Loop</a></h2>\r\nBottom line, no one ever uses Hsien-Ko. She has to be the most underused character in UMvC3, just about every combo I came up with is underused ( lol ). Hsien-Ko has a few loops actually, again for redundancy sake, I left the others out. Its hard coming up with some hard hitting combos with Hsiien-Ko alone without burning tons of meter, so I went with fancy instead.\r\n<h2><a title=\"Hsien-Ko UMVC3\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5eSoM9jefs&amp;t=1m05s\" target=\"_blank\">Hsien-Ko: 1:05 - Command Grab Whiff</a></h2>\r\nSilly!!! She can whiff her command grab and keep combo going!! GOD I love UMvC3. Im going to see who else can do this and report my findings in the near future.\r\n<h2><a title=\"Doctor Doom UMVC3\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5eSoM9jefs&amp;t=1m14s\" target=\"_blank\">Doctor Doom: 1:14 - From the Corner back into the Corner</a></h2>\r\nAgain in my journey to see how Doom's Green Laser can be used mid combo. You can actually do this mid screen as well. May have to alter it a bit to bring them back in the corner. But from the corner I think it the best option for this, since Doom can really capitalize from having the opponent in the corner.\r\n<h2><a title=\"Shuma Gorath UMvC3\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5eSoM9jefs&amp;t=1m32s\" target=\"_blank\">Shuma Gorath: 1:32 - Mystic Stares!</a></h2>\r\nShuma is such a crazy character yet no one uses him either in UMvC3. My original goal was going to try and build enough meter for a level 3 from one bar, but it just wasn't happening with Solo Shuma. I might give it a try again with assits to see if I can biuld up 2 extra bars for a TOD ( Touch of Death ) combo. Also this is actually two combos in one. I wanted to show the different situations you are left with depending on which super is done.\r\n\r\nWith Mystic Ray, you can actually hit the opponent with a light after the last set of eyes blow up and force them to Air Tech into a grab reset. With Mystic Smash. the opponent is forced to block when they get up or get hit with the exploding eyes. If they block you can command grab them into a full blown combo, or if they decide to hit a button you have enough time to confirm into combo as well.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHope everyone enjoyed the video and learned something out of it.

If you aren't, JADE is a high performance template engine built by the same people who brought us NodeJS and heavily influenced by <a href=\"http://haml.info/\" target=\"_blank\">HAML</a>. JADE is usually the goto solution for NodeJS powered sites.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2><strong>JADE with a Pre-Processor</strong></h2>\nPaired up with pre-processor, JADE can be used to create webpages that are easy to create and manage. JADE allows for importing, including and extending files, iteration, variables and much more. In this tutorial we'll be using [CodeKit](<a href=\"http://incident57.com/codekit/\" target=\"_blank\">http://incident57.com/codekit/</a>) to pre-process our JADE.\n<h2><strong>CodeKit Crash Course</strong></h2>\nAll thats needed to use CodeKit is to open the app and drag your project folder inside. CodeKit will process the JADE files every time the file is saved.\n<h2><strong>HTML Tags and Basic Syntax</strong></h2>\nJADE's syntax is pretty simple. It is written basically just the way HTML is just without the closing tags. For example, here is a really simple HTML file written in JADE.\n<h5>Jade</h5>\n<pre class=\"lang:default decode:true\">html\n    head\n        title HTML from JADE\n    body\n        h1 Here is an H1 Tag</pre>\n<h5><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">HTML</span></h5>\n<pre class=\"lang:xhtml decode:true\">&lt;html&gt;\n   &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;HTML from JADE&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;Here is a H1 Tag&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</pre>\nIndentation is very important in JADE. Indenting lets JADE know that a particular tag should be nested inside another. In the following example the div tags are siblings and the paragraph tags are nested inside a div.\n<h5>JADE</h5>\n<pre class=\"lang:default decode:true\">div\n    p\ndiv\n    p</pre>\n<h5>HTML</h5>\n<pre class=\"lang:xhtml decode:true\">&lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\nPutting text inside of a tag is as simple as placing a space followed by the text you want to populate the tag with.\n<h5>JADE</h5>\n<pre class=\"lang:default decode:true\">div\n    p Here is a p tag\ndiv\n    p Here goes a second paragraph</pre>\n<h5>HTML</h5>\n<pre class=\"lang:xhtml decode:true\">&lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Here is a p tag&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Here goes a second paragraph&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<h2><strong>Attributes</strong></h2>\nNow <strong>Attributes</strong> in JADE are simple as well. To add an attribute, place them inside parenthesis after the tag. Separate each set of attributes by comma.\n<h5>JADE</h5>\n<pre class=\"lang:default decode:true\">div\n    h1(class=\"red\", id=\"firstHeading\") Lets make some Attributes\np\n    a(href=\"http://www.google.com\") Link to Google!</pre>\n<h5>HTML</h5>\n<pre class=\"lang:xhtml decode:true\">&lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;h1 class=\"red\" id=\"firstHeading\"&gt;Lets make some Attributes&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.google.com\"&gt;Link to Google!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<h2>IDs and Classes</h2>\nThere's a shortcut for indicating classes and id's. You can of course go the attribute route and put them in parenthesis with the other attributes or you can just place it after the tag like this:\n<h5>JADE</h5>\n<pre class=\"lang:default decode:true\">p#first This is how you create an ID\np.second This is how you make a Class</pre>\n<h5>HTML<em id=\"__mceDel\"><em id=\"__mceDel\">\n</em></em></h5>\n<pre class=\"lang:xhtml decode:true\">&lt;p id=\"first\"&gt;This is how you create an ID&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"second\"&gt;This is how you make a Class&lt;/p&gt;</pre>\nPlace a hash(#) after the tag to create an ID. Place a decimal(.) after the tag to create a class. It's as simple as that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat's it for Part 1, follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=kreativeking\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> or subscribe to the <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/imkreative\" target=\"_blank\">RSS</a> Feed to be notified when Part 2 is posted.","html":"<p><img class=\"hero-image\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/imkreative/image/upload/v1398918125/jade_co5bhd.jpg\" />  </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"lang:default decode:true\"><strong>What is JADE?</strong></h2>  \n\n<p class=\"lang:default decode:true\">Anyone familiar with <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">NodeJS</a> should be familiar with JADE.

Contrary to what I originally planned, I wanted to post at least 5 times a month on here. I'm working more to that goal starting with this post, but there's a good reason why I've been away. A lot of new opportunities have been popping up left and right and learning new languages.\n\nI've been giving a ton of attention to my web app \"<a title=\"Did You Block Me\" href=\"http://didyoublock.me\" target=\"_blank\">Did You Block Me</a>\", which recently ( In the past few weeks ) has been getting way more traffic than ever since I soft launched it in January.

The best way I learn personally is by doing. When it comes to reading manuals and books on new languages, I'm very prone to getting bored or falling asleep.

It seemed like a very small goal and a good way to practice Node and brush up on the <a title=\"Developer Twitter \" href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter API</a>. After I got the basic skeleton up I started to add other features such as ways to manage who you've blocked in the past and the ability to block friends and followers. I didn't realize until creating this that Twitter doesn't have a place on its website where you can see who you've blocked. This is usually a void apps have filled.\n\nLaunched <a title=\"Did You Block Me\" href=\"http://didyoublock.me\" target=\"_blank\">Did You Block Me</a> in the beginning of January to very minimal popularity and minimal expectations honestly. Fast forward a few months, checking the analytics I've noticed a spike in usage all of a sudden, from 1 - 2 users a week ( which was probably me ) up to 40 - 50 users a day. That might not be a lot for most web apps, but this was a big deal for me. In addition the Twitter account for the app started gaining followers quickly on a daily basis. All this new traffic gave me a drive to make the app better.\n\n[cta headline=\"Sign Up for Notifications\" buttontext=\"Sign Up\" buttonlink=\"http://eepurl.com/AK88b\" ] So that's where I am now with the app, adding new features and refreshing the design for the masses.
